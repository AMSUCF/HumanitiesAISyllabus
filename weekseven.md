## Tutorial: Video

Generative AI video is still emerging: while there are many tools available already using the capabilities of the technology to assist in the modification of video content, relatively few models have been released that allow for full image-to-video or text-to-video content directly to the consumer market. Precursors to these tools, such as deepfakes video creators for working from photos or video to create false content featuring particular people, generally require dataset preparation of a type we won't be engaging here. Instead, we'll be running a limited experiment with generative video this week, then looking at the larger claims and outputs from companies developing tools in this space.

### Image to Video Exploration

For this exercise, you'll need a few images that are either in the public domain or that you hold the rights to, and a free account with a generative video tool. Given the current coverage of Runway, I suggest using their free trial for this exercise: I used it to generate this sample of a moving butterfly:
