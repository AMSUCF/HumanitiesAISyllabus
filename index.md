## Course Description

This course offers an exploration of the theory and practice of
artificial intelligence and its use in textual, visual, and procedural
arts and humanities work. The course is divided into three units,
reflecting these primary areas of the usage of AI, and engaging with
both creative examples and theoretical critiques of that usage:

-   **Textual.** In the textual unit, we will consider the history of
    textual generation and analysis, with attention to both the
    exploitation of and applications for archives, literature, and
    historical work. Students will engage in textual generation and textual analysis.
-   **Visual.** In the visual unit, we will explore visual generation
    and its challenges for authorship and meaning, with attention to
    parallel discussions in modern and postmodern media. Students will
    engage in generation for both visual material and for image-texts
    and consider the changing perspectives on artists and creativity.
-   **Procedural.** In the procedural unit, we will dive into the layer
    of code, with attention to the history of generative practices in
    both electronic literature and digital humanities usage. Students
    will co-author code and interactive projects with AI models,
    focusing on use cases for libraries, archives, museums, and artistic
    expression.

The final weeks will focus on combinatorial practices of
textual-visual-procedural generation that bring these methods together
with human imagination towards arts and humanities problems. Each week,
plan on following the module for all asynchronous activities. Each
module will be divided into three sections:

-   **Weekly Readings.** Complete this combination of primary and
    secondary texts prior to starting the making exercise. The full
    schedule of required readings is listed in the syllabus: additional
    recommended readings will be provided in each module.
-   **Generative Exercises.** Each week's generative exercise will
    involve experimenting with a different tool for AI: guidance will be
    provided on configuring and getting started with the tool, and
    students will be required to purchases subscriptions to OpenAI for
    some exercises.
-   **Reflective Discussion.** A weekly online discussion will provide
    the opportunity to share the process of making: the emphasis is not
    on "success" or "failure," but on critiquing the process and
    products through a theoretical lens.

## Course Objectives

-   Engage in both critical and creative projects exploring the pitfalls
    and potentials of large language models in visual, textual, and
    procedural work
-   Understand the history and implications of computer-augmentation
    across the arts and humanities
-   Make connections between contemporary policies around AI and past
    debates and perspectives on other technologies
-   Use large datasets to solve problems in the arts and humanities,
    with attention to evaluating and critiquing these methods alongside
    more traditional approaches in these disciplines
-   Use and analyze the application of AI generative methods for
    textual, visual, and procedural work.
-   Critique policies and uses of AI in various communities and contexts
    (the workplace, academia, etc.)

|--------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|
| 5      | **Activity Verification** - Complete the brief survey posted on Webcourses as soon as possible to confirm your enrollment in the course. As this is required by the university, please attend to it as soon as possible at the start of classes. | Friday, August 26 |
| 75     | **Generative Exercises** - Weekly discussions will consist of making, sharing, and reflecting on the process of exploring. We will work from tutorials and try a new form every week, with reflective questions connecting our process of making to the theoretical frameworks and provocations offered by our readings. | Weekly |
| 20     | **Reflection** - During the final exam week, students will complete a reflective essay on their journey, with particular consideration to next steps and potential future applications of the making mechanisms introduced throughout the semester. This reflection should include AI-generated material alongside materials produced directly by the student. | Tuesday, December 7th |


Students can access their grades and feedback at any time using the
Grade Book function of Webcourses. All assignments will be submitted
through Webcourses. Plan on checking the site at least twice a week for
updates and assignment information. Grades are calculated out of 100
following a standard letter scale.

Late work is accepted without penalty for one week after the listed
deadline. If circumstances require extension beyond that deadline,
please reach out to the instructor immediately.

There is one extra credit making exercise option available at the end of
the semester for those who miss a weeek. Grades will be available
through Webcourses and updated weekly.

## Asynchronous Online Course Structure

This course uses a fully asynchronous online format, and relies upon
students to complete all readings, engage with both course lectures and
other online videos, and join in on course discussions. All assignments
are due at the close of their listed module, but will be accepted with
no penalty through the next listed deadline. Once an assignment closes,
late work will not be accepted unless an additional extension has
already been approved by the instructor: please reach out early if
circumstances will require additional time!

-   The course has no synchronous meeting requirements: however,
    students are encouraged to engage in optional check-in meetings to
    think through their process and growth. Optional synchronous
    meetings will be scheduled based on the poll conducted in the first
    week of class.
-   Office hour assistance is additionally available both through text
    on Webcourses messages and via Zoom: Zoom is recommended for
    advanced technical problems, where screen-sharing might be helpful
    to resolving errors.
-   Students will need access to a reliable internet connection and
    computer to participate in this course. Due to some of the AI tool
    installation needs, administrative access to the system is required
    to complete assignments.
-   In the event of an emergency or medical challenge, additional
    flexibility beyond the grading guidelines is available: when
    anticipated, students should reach out to the instructor as soon as
    feasible to form a plan or discuss an incomplete if needed.

## General Policies

### Academic Integrity

[The Center for Academic Integrity (CAI)](http://academicintegrity.org/)
defines academic integrity as a commitment, even in the face of
adversity, to five fundamental values: honesty, trust, fairness,
respect, and responsibility. From these values flow principles of
behavior that enable academic communities to translate ideals into
action.

**UCF Creed:** Integrity, scholarship, community, creativity, and
excellence are the core values that guide our conduct, performance, and
decisions.

1.  Integrity: I will practice and defend academic and personal honesty.
2.  Scholarship: I will cherish and honor learning as a fundamental
    purpose of my membership in the UCF community.
3.  Community: I will promote an open and supportive campus environment
    by respecting the rights and contributions of every individual.
4.  Creativity: I will use my talents to enrich the human experience.
5.  Excellence: I will strive toward the highest standards of
    performance in any endeavor I undertake.

Students should familiarize themselves with [UCF's Rules of
Conduct](https://scai.sdes.ucf.edu/student-rules-of-conduct/). According
to Section 1, "Academic Misconduct," students are prohibited from
engaging in

1.  Unauthorized assistance: Using or attempting to use unauthorized
    materials, information or study aids in any academic exercise unless
    specifically authorized by the instructor of record. The
    unauthorized possession of examination or course-related material
    also constitutes cheating.
2.  Communication to another through written, visual, electronic, or
    oral means: The presentation of material which has not been studied
    or learned, but rather was obtained through someone else's efforts
    and used as part of an examination, course assignment, or project.
3.  Commercial Use of Academic Material: Selling of course material to
    another person, student, and/or uploading course material to a
    third-party vendor without authorization or without the express
    written permission of the university and the instructor. Course
    materials include but are not limited to class notes, Instructor's
    PowerPoints, course syllabi, tests, quizzes, labs, instruction
    sheets, homework, study guides, handouts, etc.
4.  Falsifying or misrepresenting the student's own academic work.
5.  Plagiarism: Using or appropriating another's work without any
    indication of the source, thereby attempting to convey the
    impression that such work is the student's own.
6.  Multiple Submissions: Submitting the same academic work for credit
    more than once without the express written permission of the
    instructor.
7.  Helping another violate academic behavior standards.
8.  Soliciting assistance with academic coursework and/or degree
    requirements.

### Responses to Academic Dishonesty, Plagiarism, or Cheating

Students should also familiarize themselves with the procedures for
academic misconduct in UCF's student handbook, [The Golden
Rule](https://goldenrule.sdes.ucf.edu/). UCF faculty members have a
responsibility for students' education and the value of a UCF degree,
and so seek to prevent unethical behavior and respond to academic
misconduct when necessary. Penalties for violating rules, policies, and
instructions within this course can range from a zero on the exercise to
an "F" letter grade in the course. In addition, an Academic Misconduct
report could be filed with the Office of Student Conduct, which could
lead to disciplinary warning, disciplinary probation, or deferred
suspension or separation from the University through suspension,
dismissal, or expulsion with the addition of a "Z" designation on one's
transcript.

### Course Accessibility Statement

This course is built with universal design for learning principles in
mind: if you encounter challenges with any of the course materials,
assignments, platforms, or requirements, please reach out for
assistance, and know that additional support is always available
regardles of documentation.

Additionally, the University of Central Florida is committed to
providing access and inclusion for all persons with disabilities.
Students with disabilities who need access to course content due to
course design limitations should contact the professor as soon as
possible. Students should also connect with [Student Accessibility
Services (SAS)](http://sas.sdes.ucf.edu/) (Ferrell Commons 185,
sas@ucf.edu, phone 407-823-2371). For students connected with SAS, a
Course Accessibility Letter may be created and sent to professors, which
informs faculty of potential course access and accommodations that might
be necessary and reasonable. Determining reasonable access and
accommodations requires consideration of the course design, course
learning objectives and the individual academic and course barriers
experienced by the student. Further conversation with SAS, faculty and
the student may be warranted to ensure an accessible course experience.

### Campus Safety Statement

Emergencies on campus are rare, but if one should arise during class,
everyone needs to work together. Students should be aware of their
surroundings and familiar with some basic safety and security concepts.

-   In case of an emergency, dial 911 for assistance.
-   Every UCF classroom contains an emergency procedure guide posted on
    a wall near the door. Students should make a note of the guide's
    physical location and review the [online
    version](http://emergency.ucf.edu/emergency_guide.html).
-   Students should know the evacuation routes from each of their
    classrooms and have a plan for finding safety in case of an
    emergency.
-   If there is a medical emergency during class, students may need to
    access a first-aid kit or AED (Automated External Defibrillator). To
    learn where those are located, see
    [locations](https://ehs.ucf.edu/automated-external-defibrillator-aed-locations).
-   To stay informed about emergency situations, students can sign up to
    receive UCF text alerts by going to [MyUCF](https://my.ucf.edu) and
    logging in. Click on "Student Self Service" located on the left side
    of the screen in the toolbar, scroll down to the blue "Personal
    Information" heading on the Student Center screen, click on "UCF
    Alert", fill out the information, including e-mail address, cell
    phone number, and cell phone provider, click "Apply" to save the
    changes, and then click "OK."
-   Students with special needs related to emergency situations should
    speak with their instructors outside of class.
-   To learn about how to manage an active-shooter situation on campus
    or elsewhere, consider viewing this
    [video](https://youtu.be/NIKYajEx4pk).

### Deployed Active Duty Military Students

Students who are deployed active duty military and/or National Guard
personnel and require accommodation should contact their instructors as
soon as possible after the semester begins and/or after they receive
notification of deployment to make related arrangements.

### Authorized Events and Religious Observances

Students who represent the university in an authorized event or activity
(for example, student-athletes) and who are unable to meet a course
deadline due to a conflict with that event must provide the instructor
with documentation in advance to arrange a make-up. No penalty will be
applied.

Students must notify their instructor in advance if they intend to miss
class for a religious observance. For more information, see the [UCF
policy](http://regulations.ucf.edu/chapter5/documents/5.020ReligiousObservancesFINALJan19.pdf).

### Title IX Policy

Title IX prohibits sex discrimination, including sexual misconduct,
sexual violence, sexual harassment, and retaliation. If you or someone
you know has been harassed or assaulted, you can find resources
available to support the victim, including confidential resources and
information concerning reporting options at
<https://letsbeclear.ucf.edu> and <http://cares.sdes.ucf.edu/>.
